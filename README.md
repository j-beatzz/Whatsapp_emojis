# WhatsApp Emojis

Chrome extension for emoji keyboard short cuts. Not yet added to the Chrome
Extension Store. It's really good at providing the convenience of not having to
move you fingers from the keyboard.

* Making use of [this repo](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data) for updating
emoji listing generated by
[this repo](https://github.com/j-beatzz/emoji_extractor) for use here.

## Known Bugs
* At the moment, emojis just show up as unicode chars in the input box.
 They are formatted correctly by WhatsApp when the message is sent. (Might not
be an issue afterall but still need to look into this).
* A couple of emojis (less common ones) don't show up as emoji's after message
 has been sent. This is because the extension does not use actual whatsapp
 emojis.
